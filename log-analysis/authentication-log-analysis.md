# 📊 Authentication Log Analysis

---

## Overview
Authentication logs provide critical visibility into login activity across systems.  
Analyzing these logs allows SOC analysts to detect suspicious behavior such as brute-force attempts, password spraying, unauthorized access, and abnormal login patterns.

---

## Log Source
Authentication logs are typically generated by operating systems, authentication services, and applications.  
Common locations include:

- **Linux:** `/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/secure`
- **Windows:** Security Event Logs
- **Applications:** Web application authentication logs

---

## Example Log Entries

### Successful Login
Accepted password for user1 from 192.168.1.15 port 55231 ssh2


**Interpretation:**
- A successful authentication occurred
- Includes username, source IP, and connection type
- Useful for tracking login activity and identifying unusual login times or locations

---

### Failed Login Attempt
Failed password for invalid user admin from 203.0.113.45 port 41235 ssh2


**Interpretation:**
- An authentication attempt failed
- Could indicate incorrect credentials or malicious activity
- Repeated occurrences may signal brute-force attempts

---

## Suspicious Indicators

Analysts should investigate authentication logs when observing:

- Multiple failed login attempts targeting a single account
- Failed login attempts targeting multiple accounts from the same IP
- Login attempts occurring at unusual hours
- Successful logins immediately following repeated failures
- Logins originating from unexpected geographic locations

---

## Basic Analysis Approach

1. Identify repeated authentication failures
2. Determine whether attempts target single or multiple accounts
3. Review source IP addresses for suspicious patterns
4. Check for successful logins following failed attempts
5. Document findings and escalate if suspicious behavior is confirmed

## Importance for SOC Analysts
Authentication log analysis is a fundamental SOC Level 1 responsibility, enabling early detection of account compromise attempts and supporting rapid incident triage and response.
